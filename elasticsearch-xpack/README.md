# Elasticsearch6::XPack

A Ruby integration for the [X-Pack extension](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/xpack-introduction.html) for Elasticsearch6.


## Installation

Install the package from [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org):

    gem install elasticsearch-xpack

To use an unreleased version, either add it to your `Gemfile` for [Bundler](http://gembundler.com):

    gem 'elasticsearch-xpack', git: 'https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby.git'


## Usage

If you use the official [Ruby client for Elasticsearch6](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby),
require the library in your code, and all the methods will be automatically available in the `xpack` namespace:

```ruby
require 'elasticsearch'
require 'elasticsearch/xpack'

client = Elasticsearch6::Client.new url: 'http://elastic:changeme@localhost:9200'

client.xpack.info
# => {"build"=> ..., "features"=> ...}
```

The integration is designed as a standalone `Elasticsearch6::XPack::API` module, so it's easy
to mix it into a different client, and the methods will be available in the top namespace.

For documentation, look into the RDoc annotations in the source files, which contain links to the
official [X-Pack for the Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/index.html) documentation.

For examples, look into the [`examples`](examples) folder in this repository.

You can use the provided `test:elasticsearch` Rake task to launch
a [Docker-based](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html)
Elasticsearch6 node with the full X-Pack license preinstalled.
