        # A single-bucket aggregation which allows to aggregate on "parent" documents
        # from the nested documents
        #
        # @example
        #
        #     search do
        #       aggregation :offers do
        #         nested do
        #           path 'offers'
        #           aggregation :top_categories do
        #             reverse_nested do
        #               aggregation :top_category_per_offer do
        #                 terms field: 'category'
        #               end
        #             end
        #           end
        #         end
        #       end
